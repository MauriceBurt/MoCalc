# MoCalc - Version 2.x Series

## 🧠 Overview

Version 2 of MoCalc introduces **modular design** and powerful subnetting tools for junior network engineers and IT pros. Built in Python, this version moves beyond basic math — into real-world networking.

## 📌 Key Milestones

### ✅ v2.0 – Foundation & Modular Classes
- Created `Greeting`, `BasicCalculator`, and `SubnettingCalculator` classes
- Refactored v1 logic into structured, reusable components
- Added looping options and return-to-main logic

### ✅ v2.1 – Binary Conversion
- Implemented option to convert an IP address into binary
- Cleaned up subnetting structure for future expansion

### ✅ v2.2 – Binary UI Upgrades
- Improved binary converter to format each octet clearly
- Added prompts to return to menu or continue converting

### ✅ v2.3 – Intelligent Validation
- Input validation for octet ranges (0–255)
- Better user prompts and instructions for subnetting tools
- Cleaner logic and exit handling

### ✅ v2.4 - Advanced Subnetting + VLSM Support
- Added Option B: Calculate total and usable hosts from a CIDR block
- Added Option C: Determine subnet address from IP and CIDR input
- Added Option D: VLSM-based subnet planning from a base IP and device counts
- Outputs include: **network ID**, **CIDR**, **total hosts**, **usable IP range**, and **broadcast address**
- Refined logic flow and improved user feedback handlign throughout

## 🧪 Designed For:
- 📚 **Teachers** introducing students to subnetting or binary
- 🏢 **Companies** who need an internal tool for quick calculations
- 🛠 **Field professionals** doing IP planning or troubleshooting
- 💡 **Students** and **junior network engineers** learning the ropes
- 🧮 Anyone dealing with **subnets**, **IP math**, or **binary conversions**
---

## 🚧 Coming Soon in v3.x:
- 🖥  **GUI version using PyQt — for those who prefer windows over CLI
- 📦  **pip install support — install MoCalc like any other Python tool
- 🐳  *Optional:* **Docker container** for portable usage
- 🔌  *Optional:* **API wrapper** for integrating with other tools
