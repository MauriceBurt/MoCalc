📍 Why I Built It

As a Certified Network Engineer working toward Azure mastery, I wanted more than just online tools — I wanted my own custom utility belt. MoCalc reflects how I work: modular, efficient, and always evolving. It’s built to support engineers like me who need quick results, repeatable logic, and room to grow.
